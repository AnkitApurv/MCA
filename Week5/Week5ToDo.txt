 Here is a list of programming questions that all of you need to code and test. The programs can be written in any programming language of your choice C/C++/Java.  The soft copies of the code is to be submitted on the 7th of January 2019.

Coding Conventions to be used are as follows:

    Every program to have documentation in comment lines in the top mentioning file name, description of the program, author and date
    Every function should have documentation with description about  the functionality is , input parameters and return value
    Use meaningful variable names, function names with camel casing
    Indentation 


Program List

    1. Write a program to find the sum of the digits of a number using recursion.
    2. Write a menu driven  Program using function to concatenate, compare, find length, convert to lower/upper case strings using pointers.

   Prototypes : a. int StrLen(char S[]);                                  b. void StrCpy(char S[], char T[]);
                c. int StrCmp(char S[], char T[]);             d. void StrCat(char S[],char T[]);
                e. void ToUpper(char S[]);                        f. void ToLower(char S[]);
    3. Write a program to find the most frequent word in an array of strings.
    4.(a) Write a program to construct a binary  search tree using linked list. 
    4.(b) Given a binary search tree(BST) , write a method to count the number of leaf nodes in the BST.  The method takes one argument, the root of BST. 
    4.(c) Given a binary search tree(BST) , write a method to find the height of the  BST.  The method takes one argument, the root of BST. 
    5.  Given an array of integers, sort the array according to frequency of elements. For example, if the input array is {2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 12, 2, 3, 3, 3, 12}, then modify the array to {3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 12, 12, 4, 5}.  If frequencies of two elements are same, print them in increasing order.
