Why use UML?
UML has become the de-facto standard for modeling object-oriented
systems.
UML is extensible and method-independent.
UML is not perfect, but it's good enough. ***
Three OOAD gurus, and their methods, rose to prominence
1. Grady Booch — The Booch Method
2. James Rumbaugh, et al. — Object Modeling Technique
3. Ivar Jacsobson — Objectory
UML Figure Types
-
-
-
There are several types of UML diagrams:
Use-case Figure
- Shows actors, use-cases, and the relationships between them.
Class Figure
Shows relationships between classes and pertinent information about
classes themselves.
Object Figure
- Shows a configuration of objects at an instant in time.
Interaction Figures
- Show an interaction between a group of collaborating objects.
- Two types: Collaboration diagram and sequence diagram
Package Figure
- Shows system structure at the library/package level.
State Figure
- Describes behavior of instances of a class in terms of states, stimuli, and
transitions.
Activity Figure
Very similar to a flowchart—shows actions and decision points, but with
the ability to accommodate concurrency.
Deployment Figure
Shows configuration of hardware and software in a distributed system.
